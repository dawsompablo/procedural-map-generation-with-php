# Procedural Map Generator (in PHP)

## Description

The Procedural Map Generator project in PHP is an initiative focused on studying and practicing procedural programming, particularly in the PHP language. The main objective is to create a system capable of generating maps procedurally, providing a hands-on experience in manipulating terrain generation algorithms.

## Planned Features

1. **Terrain Generation:** Implementation of procedural terrain generation algorithms, such as Perlin Noise, to create realistic and diverse maps.
2. **Map Customization:** Ability to customize parameters, such as map size, terrain smoothness, element density, among others, to allow a wide range of variations.

## System Requirements

- **[PHP 8.2:](https://www.php.net/downloads)** The project requires PHP version 8 or higher for optimal functionality.
- **[Composer:](https://getcomposer.org/)** Composer is essential for managing PHP dependencies. Ensure it is installed to handle project dependencies effectively.

## Technologies Used

- PHP: Primary language for project development.
- HTML/CSS: For creating a simple graphical interface.

## Basic usage

Use the [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to generate autoloader:

```
composer install
```

If everything is ok, start the local server inside the files folder:

```
php -S localhost:8000
```
